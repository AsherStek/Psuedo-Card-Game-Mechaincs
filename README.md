# Two Tribes Battle System Idea - Scorpio

## Cards

    The "cards" are essentially an obfuscation for any standard combat options 
    i.e. attack, use potion, etc. Cards are individual items that will be store in 
    a deck seperately. By approaching it like this actually desiging a large amount 
    of cards will be fairly simple as the only difficult part of would be tying 
    actions to the card item. I also believe the approach would allow us to spend more
    time working on more complex features with card interation.

## Decks

    A deck can be treated as a single item in the player's inventory that opens another sub menu to edit the deck.
