# Psuedo Card Game Battle System

By, ScorpioGameKing

## Synopsis

    The idea is fairly basic (if this is used in RPG Maker) as all we're doing is
    obfuscating the normal commands with "cards" which are just items that execute
    the command. The more time consuming part of creating the system would most
    likely be the AI, Deck Management, and balancing. With how cards are made it'd
    be fairly easy to make a wide variety just with the built in RPG Maker options.

    Now this idea is still fairly simple and hopefully that'd make it easier to 
    incorperate team member's ideas and build it further. While it can function on
    it's own as a combat system, I do realize the it's incredibly simple and would
    most likely get old rather quick. As such I see this as more of a foundation
    to turn into something that as a team we can be proud of.
